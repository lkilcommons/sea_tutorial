<p>In this superposed epoch plot, I am showing the response of the Disturbance Storm Time index to Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) hitting
the earth's magnetic field. The DST measures the strength of the ring current, and is a proxy for the overall geomagnetic activity.
The green lines each represent an individual storm, and the red, black, and blue lines are the statistical response</p>

<a id="what-is-superposed-epoch-analysis" class="anchor" href="#what-is-superposed-epoch-analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is superposed epoch analysis?</h2>

<p>Superposed epoch analysis, also called <em>compositing</em>, 
is a technique for analyzing data that consists of measurements of the state of some observable system over time, 
i.e. a <em>timeseries</em>. More specifically, timeseries data in which some type of event repeatedly reoccurs.</p>

<h2>
<a id="an-example" class="anchor" href="#an-example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An example</h2>

<p>For a simple example from space science, we can consider the eleven year solar cycle, as measured by the sunspot number:
<img src="http://spaceweather.com/glossary/images2009/zurich_strip.gif" alt="Image of the solar cycle"></p>

<p>While the activity of the sun waxes and wanes every eleven years, there are stronger and weaker cycles. 
Let's say that we want to develop a simple model to solar forecasters predict the average sunspot number and the range 
we would expect for any given point in future solar cycles. This is a perfect use case for the superposed epoch analysis.</p>

<h2>
<a id="step-zero-get-ready" class="anchor" href="#step-zero-get-ready" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step zero: get ready</h2>

<p>The first tasks in any superposed epoch analysis are to obtain and import your timeseries data.
Without data, there is no analysis!</p>

<p>I got the data here:
<a href="http://www.sidc.be/silso/INFO/sndtotcsv.php">Sunspot number data as a CSV (comma separated variable) file</a>
But it comes as part of the git repository.</p>

<p>Now we must import the data into MATLAB. If you want to follow along, replace the path to the 
data (<code>/home/liamk/mirror/Projects/superposedepoch_tutorial/</code>) with where you cloned or unzipped the git repository
on your computer.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-matlab"><pre>sunspot_data = <span class="pl-k">importdata</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>/home/liamk/mirror/Projects/superposedepoch_tutorial/SN_d_tot_V2.0.csv<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>);</pre></div>

<p>We will need to understand what is in our data.</p>

<p>From SIDC website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contents:<br>
Column 1: Year<br>
Column 2: Month<br>
Column 3: Day<br>
Column 4: Date in fraction of year.<br>
Column 5: Daily total sunspot number. A value of -1 indicates that no number is available for that day (missing value).<br>
Column 6: Daily standard deviation of the input sunspot numbers from individual stations.<br>
Column 7: Number of observations used to compute the daily value.<br>
Column 8: Definitive/provisional indicator. '1' indicates that the value is definitive. '0' indicates that the value is still provisional.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's usually easier to work with time as a single, monotonically increasing number, rather than having to think about
how many days are in each month, etc,etc, so it's nice that the data provides us with column 4: "date in fraction of year".
Let's define that as our time variable, and then use the data from column 5 for our analysis.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-matlab"><pre>time = sunspot_data(:,<span class="pl-c1">4</span>);
ssn = sunspot_data(:,<span class="pl-c1">5</span>);</pre></div>

<p>Next we should take care of those pesky missing values. If you leave them in there, they can really mess things up. 
We'll just cut them out of the data entirely.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-matlab"><pre>missing = ssn <span class="pl-k">==</span> -<span class="pl-c1">1</span>;
time = time(~missing);
ssn = ssn(~missing);</pre></div>

<p>Now we can really begin.</p>

<a id="step-1-identify-the-events" class="anchor" href="#step-1-identify-the-events" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 1: Identify the events</h2>

<p>Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) is all about <em>events</em>, which we can define as re-occurrences of some type of cyclical or episodic process.
Basically, SEA is appropriate for analyzing anything that happens which has a beginning, middle, and end,
and plays out similarly over time each time it happens.</p>

<p>Examples of cyclical processes from earth sciences include our solar cycle example, or temperatures at a particular
weather station in Canada during the rise and fall of the El Nino. Episodic processes
could include hurricanes passing by a particular observation station in the Pacific ocean, or earthquakes from a particular fault,
which are observed by a particular seismometer station, or coronal mass ejections hitting the earth's magnetosphere, as observed by ACE, 
the upstream solar wind monitor spacecraft.</p>

<p>In order to identify specific events, we have to define a single time as the quantitative 'center' of the event, so we can
tell the beginning of the event apart from the middle and end, and compare the beginnings of different events with eachother,
as opposed to the beginning of one event with the end of another, etc. In this way we can get a picture of how the process
plays out over time for a 'typical' event.</p>

<p>Our events will be individual solar cycles. We will use the maximum sunspot number for each solar cycle as our center time (sometimes called the zero epoch time)</p>

<p>I'll give the code for the center times, but I looked them up for the nearest month on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_solar_cycles">wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Note that these are in fractions of the year, the same as our sunspot observation times. Convenient!</p>

<p>Since we want to analyze the response of a typical event, we need to pick an amount of time before and after the
zero epoch time in which we think we will see something interesting. Since the shortest solar cycle on our list
is about 9 years, it should be safe to do +- 4 years around our zero epoch time.</p>

<p>If we want to know what the sunspot number 1 year before the maximum is on average, and how that differs from 2 years before,
we need to divide each event into discrete time bins, so that the times for event 1 line up with exactly with the times for
event 2, etc. This makes the rest of the process a lot easier because the results can be stored in 
a [number of events x number of time bins] matrix</p>

<p>Now that we have the data all nicely arranged in a matrix <code>ssn_by_event</code>, where

<p>Many people will skip the time binning step and just try to line up the data for each 
event by depending on the fact that the data comes in on a regular cadence (in the case of our sunspot data, 
this is one value for each day). In this case, you can simply define each event as +- 1461
values from the data array around the index of the value at the zero epoch time:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-matlab"><pre><span class="pl-c">%Loop through each solar cycle, or 'event'</span>
<span class="pl-k">for</span> m = <span class="pl-c1">1</span>:<span class="pl-k">length</span>(solar_cycle_max_times)
  this_solar_cycle_max_time = solar_cycle_max_times(m);

  <span class="pl-c">%Assumes that time is sorted in ascending order (usually true)</span>
  closest_ssn_index_to_max_time = <span class="pl-k">find</span>(time&gt;this_solar_cycle_max_time,<span class="pl-c1">1</span>); 

  <span class="pl-c">%4 years in days = 365.25*4=1461</span>
  ssns_in_this_event = ssn(closest_ssn_index_to_max_time-<span class="pl-c1">1461</span>:closest_ssn_index_to_max_time+<span class="pl-c1">1461</span>);

  <span class="pl-c">%More code goes here later</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<p>This works fine, as long as there are no large chunks of missing data and you really can depend
on the fact that the n-th point in the data array is for day n, and the n+1-th point is for day n+1,
or whatever is the appropriate time step for your dataset.</p>
